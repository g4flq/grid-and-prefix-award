# Grid and Prefix Awards Scheme

This awards scheme was devised and run by Ernie Mills, WM2U.

Clearly he put much work into the scheme including:

* Conceiving the scheme, and with the help of others devising the rules,
* Devloping the <www.gapawards.com> website,
* Creating all the award artwork,
* Generating the tables of prefixes and Maidenhead locators,

And most importantly, for operating and maintaining the scheme for many years!

Ernie is now of an age whereby he feels he would like to pass on the baton to another, but sadly no one has yet (March 2024) come forward to run it.

So that his work doesn't evaporate, and award winners can continue to see their achievements recognised, Ernie's has made his web site available under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence and his files have now been uploaded to GitHub to preserve them for posterity. Hopefully someone will rediscover the attractions his Grid and Prefix Awards scheme as the amateur radio wheel turns full circle in the future.

In particular I would like to pay full tribute to Ernie's labour of love of compiling the list of amateur radio prefixes to Maidenhead locator squares. This has a value to the world wide amateur community far greater than his Grid & Prefix Awards scheme.
